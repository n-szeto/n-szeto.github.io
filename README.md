# Welcome to Nathan's Personal Info Page!

The purpose of this page is to provide a convenient "online resume" of sorts for
anyone interested. Also, it provided a good opportunity to practice CSS, learn
some Javascript, and become familiar with the React library. Lastly, this page
uses many components from the Elastic UI library and drew much inspiration from
Kaizen Conroy's own personal page.

## Relevant links:

* Elastic UI library: https://github.com/elastic/eui
* Kaizen Conroy's Repo: https://github.com/kaizen3031593/kaizen3031593.github.io/tree/source
* This page: https://n-szeto.github.io

Please take a look around and contact me at nss2@williams.edu w/ any questions!
